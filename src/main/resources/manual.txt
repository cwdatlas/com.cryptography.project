encrypt:%
	This command will require you to%
	input a key and the location of%
	any file on the computer. The %
	key will have to be 16 bytes, %
	which means that its 16 characters%
	long. If key isnt 16 bytes then %
	a preset 16 byte key will be used.%
	The encrypted text will%
	replace all text on the target%
	text file.%
	Decryption happens after encryption%
	happens. This is because we cant%
	reliably save the ciphertext as%
	it has characters a text file cant%
	have saved to it. The Decryption%
	method is the exact opposite of %
	the encryption method.%

Info:%
	We used unit tests to calculate time%
	taken to complete each test. The%
	user interface here is built for%
	interactivity rather than for testing.%
	The Ecryption isnt perfect, as there are%
	a couple characters that arent encrypted%
	properly. We didnt have time to depug this%
	issue, but we think it has something to do%
	with the substitution.%
